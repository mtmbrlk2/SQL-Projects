In this project, I utilized the following techniques for SQL:

Importing and mapping data bases
Outputting images of the database map
Database querying
Summarizing and cleaning data
Joining tables
Subqueries
Common table expressions

Also, I have generated a Data Dictionary for this database and organized it appropriately.
