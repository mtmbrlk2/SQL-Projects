The files herein showcase some of the skills I've obtained in SQL and DBM. This was a small class project that focused on gaining proficiency in techniques and the coding language of SQL. In this project, I utilized the following techniques and codes showcased in my files:

Importing and mapping data bases

Outputting images of the database map

Database querying

Summarizing and cleaning data

Joining tables

Subqueries

Common table expressions

Also, I have generated a Data Dictionary for this database and organized it appropriately.
